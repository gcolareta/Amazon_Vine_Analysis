# Amazon_Vine_Analysis

## Overview
In this project I am analyzing Amazon reviews written by members of the paid Amazon Vine program. Amazon Vine program is a service that allows companies to receive a review for their product by paying a small fee to Amazon and providing products to Amazon Vine members who are required to post a review on the product.

In this analysis of product reviews, I am hoping to determine if there is any bias toward favorable reviews from Vine members in a given dataset.

## Results
Fron the approximately 50 datasets I had access to, I selected the following one:
